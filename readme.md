# Station Planner for X4: Foundations and Star Wars Interworlds
This is a quick and dirty vibe coded X4 Station Planner that supports the base game (including all DLCs) and the Star Wars Interworlds mod. This planner isn't currently focused on profits, simply balancing station I/O, sunlight and habitat productivity boosts.

# Tips and Tricks
- Click the `SWI` badge in the title bar to swap between the base game and SWI mod.
- Use the bread crumb path to navigate back to the sectors view. 
- Double clicking (or dragging a connection out of) an input or output ware on your production modules will give you the option to add and wire up a corresponding production module.
- Stations automatically inherit the sunlight value of the sector they're in.

# Contributions
Contributions or issues are welcome. If this grows enough to warrant it I'll make a more formal process, but for now just submit PRs and I'll get around to them when I can.
